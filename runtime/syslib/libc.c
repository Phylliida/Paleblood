/* libc group. Only imports the runtime answers itself belong here; everything else stays
   unresolved and reports loudly by NID.

   `_init_env` (NID bzQExy189ZI) is the first import eboot calls -- at eboot+0xb9, about 25 bytes
   into the entry function -- and it initialises the C library's environment block. The guest
   supplies its own `environ` through the loader, so there is nothing for the host to do: this is
   a no-op by nature, not a stub returning zero, and the distinction matters because a permissive
   zero would hide an import that actually needed behaviour. */
