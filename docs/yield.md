# Yield per stretch, as a denominator rather than a phrase

The horizon figure (161 h at ~39 rows/h) predates the instrument phase. This records the measured alternative so a
forecast is a derivation instead of a phrase.

## Method (re-runnable, one command)

    git log origin/main..HEAD --numstat --format='@@%H%x09%s'

Classify each commit by its numstat: **row-bearing** if it adds lines to `symbols/functions.csv`, **gate-only** if
it touches `test/` or `tools/` and adds no row, **other** otherwise. Quote all three or none.

## Measured at `11e70c4`-era HEAD (68 commits, `origin/main = fa4acdf`)

| class | commits |
|---|---|
| row-bearing | **1** (`b6e4956`, **+1 row**) |
| gate-only (`test/`, `tools/`) | **39** |
| other (docs, symbols, artifacts) | **28** |

**Gate-to-row ratio: 39 : 1.** The only row added on this branch is `0x0196f030`, 15 B, status `original`.

## What it means, and what would make it wrong

A stretch that produces **a body and no new refusal surface** is the evidence that the instrument phase was an
investment. A stretch that produces **a gate and no row** moves the ratio the other way. The ratio is only meaningful
quoted with its class counts beside it -- `39` alone is a numerator wearing a rate's clothes.

The honest horizon from this record is not a number of hours: it is that **no row has yet been added twice in one
stretch**, so any projection from one row per stretch is extrapolation from n = 1, and the pre-instrument figure is
not evidence about the post-instrument tree.
